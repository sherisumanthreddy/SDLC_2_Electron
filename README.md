## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Faced issues with integrating the modules because each of us had a different coding style. But eventually, reading through code and undersanding it helped us modify it and integrate it accordingly.
2. Testing was something new to each and everyone of us in Python. We had to start from scratch and learn how to write test files for python programs.
3. Following and keeping track of every process in SDLC was very difficult. With constant support and hardwork, we were able to atleast keep up with atleast half of it.
